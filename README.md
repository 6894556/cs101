# cs101

These are the materials that I created for the introductory
programming course CS101 taught at KAIST to all freshmen students,
regardless of their major.

I created those materials in 2010, they are still used with only minor
modifications.

Lecture slides are in Ipe format (ipe7.sourceforge.net).  

The slides for the labs in the lab subdirectory where made by the TAs
for the labs in Fall 2010.
